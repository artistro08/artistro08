## Yo! I'm Devin, a Full Stack Designer. I create brands and design websites.

`Put simply, a full-stack designer is a designer that gets involved at every stage of the user experience and graphic design process, from research & code to implementation. ðŸ¦„`

So, Iâ€™ve been in the field of graphic and web design for over 12 years. Iâ€™ve had the honor to work for many clients around the world. My goal is always to help my clients achieve their goals and make the world a better place through branding, UI/UX, and beautiful design.

Design, to me, is more than just putting pictures together. Your website, logo and marketing materials need to be based on your principles, mission, and goals.  When you hire me, I will pull inspiration from you, the your client or customer base, and other existing visuals to create designs that work and communicate for you and your brand.

Branding is mandatory. I want to make sure you look good from the ground up.  Regardless of how many new tricks and tools I learn to bring your brand to life, I still have my favorites like Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Webflow, Affinity Designer and Affinity Photo. Whether you need a full website overhaul for your OctoberCMS or WordPress site or full branding redesign, my toolbox is packed with solutions. 

No matter what each job requires, Iâ€™m always up for new endeavors no matter how challenging.
